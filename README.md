# Butuan Agri-Exchange (Barter 2.0)
**Transforming Home Gardens into a Hyper-Local Micro-Economy.**

## The Vision
In response to the 2026 food inflation and the city's "Gulay sa Panimalay" initiative, **Butuan Agri-Exchange** provides a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace for urban gardeners. We turn backyard surpluses—like an overabundance of eggplants or tomatoes—into a community resource through smart bartering.

## The "Speed-Build" Stack
Built with the 2026 developer "Gold Standard" for type-safety and performance:
* **Framework:** [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) (Next.js, TypeScript, tRPC, Tailwind CSS)
* **Database:** Prisma with PostgreSQL
* **Image Intelligence:** Cloudinary for AI auto-tagging and image optimization.
* **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD optimized).

## Vercel Deployment
Use a hosted PostgreSQL database before deploying. Set `DATABASE_URL` in Vercel, along with the Cloudinary variables used by the upload route: `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`.

## Project Structure
* `src/app`: Next.js App Router for high-performance routing.
* `src/server`: Type-safe backend logic using tRPC.
* `src/components`: Reusable UI built with Tailwind CSS.
